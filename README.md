# A place for me to show my work

Welcome to the repo for my own website.
<br>

<br>
This project was started for two reasons, the first was to allow me to go back to the basics of Create-React-App, JS, HTML & CSS so that I could further refine the core skills I had picked up during the bootcamp. The second reason was that I have always wanted my own website, somewhere I can post whatever I want.
<br>
<br>
The tech-stack used for this project:<br>

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Create-React-App
- Nodejs

<br>
<br>
No fancy Nextjs, or Tailwind stuff here.
<br>
This project really taught me the importance of designing an application to be mobile-first, as I started this project not that way, and had a not very fun time re-jigging it afterwards. Oh well, it's all good experience.<br>
Thank you for checking this out! I welcome any feedback, just jot me a message :)
